# SmartBin - Automated Organic Waste Processor 
## Overview

SmartBin is an automated system that converts organic waste into compost through a controlled drying and grinding process. The system features odor control using carbon filtration, automated waste level detection, and a custom-designed ESP32-based motherboard for complete process automation.

**Key Features:**
- Automated waste level monitoring using ultrasonic sensors
- Odor control system with carbon filter and exhaust fan
- Controlled drying via 50W heating element
- Automated grinding using 120W AC blender motor with PWM speed control
- Custom PCB design with high/low-voltage isolation
- FreeRTOS-based task management

*System Schematic*

### Process Flow:
1. **Waste Collection** → Ultrasonic sensor monitors fill level
2. **Odor Filtration** → Fan pulls air through carbon filter before exhaust
3. **Drying Stage** → Heating element activates at threshold level
4. **Grinding Stage** → AC motor pulverizes dried waste
5. **Storage** → Processed compost collected in separate compartment
